## 🚀 About the Project: 
**Currency Convertor — Static Data**

A lightweight WPF desktop app that converts between currencies using static rates stored in a DataTable. The UI is built with XAML and enhanced with FontAwesome.WPF icons. Great for learning data binding, input validation, and clean MV-like separation in small apps.

## ✨ Features

**1.** Clean and modern WPF interface with styled rounded buttons  

**2.** Currency selection from drop-down menus bound to an in-memory DataTable  

**3.** Real-time numeric input validation using Regex (only numbers and decimals allowed)  

**4.** Automatic number formatting with commas for readability (e.g., 12,121.32)  

**5.** Conversion results displayed with the target currency, formatted to three decimals  

**6.** Clear and Swap actions for better usability  

**7.** Fully self-contained code with static exchange rates (no external APIs required)
